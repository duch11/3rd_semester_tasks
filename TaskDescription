Part 1:

Make a java program that reads a file, aliceinwonderland.txt, and counts how many characters of each type there is.
I.e. how many ‘a’, how many ‘b’, how many ‘c’, and so on. Disregarding upper or lower case.

When you have a count of number of characters for each character in the alphabet,
then you should calculate the percentage of each character,
i.e. how many percent of all characters is the ‘a’, the ‘b’, and so on.

Only alphabet characters, no special characters like ‘,’ or ‘.’ or ‘?



Part 2: Now count the words instead of characters.
Sort the output descending, so the word with highest occurrance comes first.



Part 3:
Make the program ask for an URL, such as the link to "Alice in Wonderland"
online https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm and then counts characters and displays percentages.



Part 4:

Add a JavaFX GUI or Web-GUI, which:

- can receive an URL for a text document

-  has an "Analyze" button

- displays a sorted list of words and count for each word in the file.
